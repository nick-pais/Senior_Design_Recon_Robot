# Senior_Design_Recon_Robot

Univeristy of Florida ECE Undergraduate Fianl Design Project for the Spring 2020 Semester. The goal of the project was to create a Recon robot that was driven with a wireless controller and allowed sensor data (CO, Combustable Gas, Smoke, Temperature) to be relayed back to the LCD on the controller from the vehicle.
